this is the source markdown for my rentrys (or tiny sites)

please do not copy from them until you want to get some rentry inspo

**please know that these rentrys are not backed up as frequently**

have a good time anyways

updated since: *july 4th, 2022*

the neocities site is still supported, but it isnt as current as the rentrys

if you're looking for the main site, [here it is](https://github.com/zettaexa/zr/blob/main/zet.txt)

if you want some other pages, just search the URL of the rentry *(instead of https://rentry.co/zet, just type zet)* and you would probably get the site
