##### -> dam channels explained <-
-> *published in 30/05/2022, written in 12/08/2021* <-
 i mean its literally anyone in this strange community of verified channels only commenting on popular videos 

how they have that much subscribers even though their catalogue is blank is that:
they bought these 100k+ subscribers youtube channels (they either come naturally grown or sub-botted)
they either privatized or deleted the videos uploaded to that bought channel
find comments on popular videos that they copy comments that doesn't give enough attention
either changing it slightly or literally just copying it, people will like the comment because the channel is verified
(with youtubes algorithm of popular sorting comments, verified commentors get the most attention instead of the regular viewer)
that way people will come to their channel because of these comments
these justin y type channels would make an excuse on why they don't have a fairly popular video that reached them to the verification mark or answering the question if they are sub-botted or not with shoving down an excuse that they were a spanish gaming channel (even though the og owner did these videos not the commentator owner) and they will say that they will make minecraft videos in the future or something like that

with a cherry on top, most of these sellers of these 100k+ subscriber channels either hack the og channels

tl;dr: people are hacking into verified yt channels and selling them for profit, then these new owners delete the original videos, copying comments, posting them and getting a ton of likes, then the commenter owner saying that they will make more content in the future and saying what the original content was about and reclaiming it by a new name, and voila you have the most unoriginal people on the planet literally surviving of attention.

im sorry if this is the longest comment you ever heard of but heres all of the truths of these cookie-cutter channels, thanks for reading.

##### -> the house in the ocean recap <-
-> *published in 08/05/2022* <-
a person and some few political figures either saw or shot the house in the ocean, and it gave them deformed body effects

the crescent king is the entity that lives in these houses and replaces other people/objects (for example walt disney transmitted a cartoon to the house and the ending result was something different) when they interact with the crescent king or the houses

the house in the ocean world finally ended as c.h.a.s.e. the robot (yes that one from the film) walked away from los vegas to antarctica and claiming the world as the void and thats it

people affected by these houses forgot about it (like how alcatraz replaced everyone in the uza)

##### -> **gluee by bladee, livetime album review** <-
-> *published in 22/04/2022* <-
-> **tldr;** i rate the gluee album, and its a 9.7/10 ->
hey all, zetta here. since febuary 2022, i was a fan of the swedish hyperpop/cloud rap singer called bladee. i played the artists discography from the oldest studio album to newest, so i started off with gluee.

anyways, here is a review of each and every track in this album, i will give out a score for the track from one to ten, so lets begin.

**1.** *deletee (intro)* — 8/10
the pad in the beginning is orchestral 
the drum beat is simple yet good
the reverb in the track gives it an extra kick
the lyrics here are pretty nice and bladees voice is more calmer and smoother
the reason why i give it an 8/10 instead of a 10, it's because of the amount of autotune in his voice
but everything is pretty good

**2.** *safehouse* — 9/10
in this track, the beat and synths are are calming and relaxing, like i could put it in a compilation for sleep music
bladees voice is more quietter than the intro, but how cares
the chorus in this track is pretty lazy
i get the meaning of this song, the lyrics are pretty creative
i give it a 9 out of 10

**3.** *ebay* — 10/10
i really like the beat and the synths of the song, its really soothing
as before the lyrics are more well thought of, i don't know why i find random words and letters creative 
so far i think the story of the album is bladee finding bladeecity, the lyrics of safehouse is what he found at a building, his exploration team (most likely drain gang) are the people who sing the song in ebay. i think the drain gang connected to bladeecity's public wifi to access ebay to buy something, take this theory like its a grain of salt because i don't know the lore of gluee or bladee but i will try my best
anyway its a pretty good song, 10/10

for now i'm just going to write the song and the score, i don't want to make long descriptions because i don't want to repeat myself, so i'll continue

**4.** *shadowface* — 9.5/10
**5.** *spellbound* — 10/10
**6.** *everlasting flames* — 8/10
**7.** *freeze* — 8/10
**8.** *upgrade enabled* — 10/10
**9.** *unreal* — 10/10

you've been waiting for my rating for this 2014 bladee album, so i give the entire album, a 9.7/10.
congratulations bladee and everyone who has worked on this album, have a great day
